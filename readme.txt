== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is DarkOnyx? =

DarkOnyx is a Flash/HTML5 Video Player for Web, but also a powerful Video Platform similar in functionality to Brightcove or Ooyala.

= What differs DarkOnyx from other video players like JWPlayer or FlowPlayer =

DarkOnyx is an intelligent HTML5/Flash hybrid player, that can automatically switch between its two modes, depending on available sources, and end-user's system (instead of just a simple fallback mechanism). It also comes with a powerful, dedicated CMS.

= If the player already has got its own CMS, why do I need this plugin? =
Plugin itself is a bridge between two platforms (DarkOnyx & Wordpress). Thanks to it, you will be able to setup most of the elements from Wordpress level without a need to operate between two scripts all the time. 

= How to install DarkOnyx? =

The installation process is almost identical to how you set up Wordpress. Check our site to learn more about it. Video tutorials both for player and plugin installation are also available!

= Is DarkOnyx free? =

Yes it is – just like the plugin. You will have to register an account on web-anatomy.com to download the player.

= Can I display my own ads in Free Edition too =

Sure you can!
