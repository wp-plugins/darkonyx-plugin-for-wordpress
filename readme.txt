== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is DarkOnyx? =

DarkOnyx is not just a Flash/HTML5 Video Player for Web, but also a powerful Video Platform similar in functionality to Brightcove or Ooyala.

= What differs DarkOnyx from other video players like JWPlayer or FlowPlayer =

DarkOnyx is an intelligent HTML5/Flash hybrid player, that can automatically switch between its two modes, depending on available sources, and end-user's system (instead of just a simple fallback mechanism). It also comes with a powerful, dedicated CMS.

= If the player already has got its own CMS, why do I need this plugin? =
Plugin itself is a bridge between two platforms (DarkOnyx & Wordpress). Thanks to that, you will be able to setup most of the settings from Wordpress level without a need to operate between two scripts all the time.
